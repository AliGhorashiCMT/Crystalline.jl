# Crystalline.jl

[![Documentation][docs-dev-img]][docs-dev-url] [![Build status][ci-status-img]][ci-status-url]

Work-in-progress research package for crystalline symmetry, irreps, and bandreps.

## Installation

The package is currently not registred in the General registry, and additionally relies on a package not listed in General (SmithNormalForm.jl). 
As a result, installation is slightly more complicated than ordinarily (albeit, not by much).

To install, enter the `pkg>` prompt by typing `]` at the REPL. Then execute the following commands:
```julia
(@v1.5) pkg> registry add https://github.com/wildart/BoffinStuff.git # needed for the SmithNormalForm.jl package, which Crystalline.jl depends on
(@v1.5) pkg> add https://github.com/thchr/Crystalline.jl
```
which will make Crystalline.jl available via 
```julia
julia> using Crystalline
```
