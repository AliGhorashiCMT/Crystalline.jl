The small irreps associated with the little group of k-point P ≡ KVec(½,½,½)
of space group 214 are not correct in ISOTROPY's dataset: specifically, while 
they have the correct characters and pass the 1st and 2nd character orthogonality
theorems, they do not pass the grand orthogonality theorem that tests the irrep
matrices themselves. To that end, we manually replace these small irreps with 
those listed by CDML (read off from their tables). 
Those irreps are manually extracted in the scripts/cdml_sg214_P1P2P3.jl file.

The fix is made in littlegroupirrep(ir::SGIrrep{<:Complex}), using the check 
in is_erroneous_lgir(...), with the constant "erroneous" tuple ERRONEOUS_LGIRS.

# We need to manually do things for the "special" k-points kᴮ from the
# representation domain Φ that do not exist in the basic domain kᴬ∈Ω
# i.e. for kᴮ∈Φ-Ω (labels like KA, ZA, etc.), which are not included 
# in ISOTROPY. We can do this by first finding a transformation R such 
# that kᴮ = Rkᴬ, and then transforming the LGIrrep of kᴬ appropriately
# (see CDMLSec. 4.1 / B&C Sec. 5.5.). Parts of the steps are like this:
#
#       kvmaps = ΦnotΩ_kvecs(sgnum, D) # from src/special_representation_domain_kpoints.jl
#       if kvmaps !== nothing # contains KVecs in the representation domain Φ that 
#                           # cannot be mapped to ones in the basic domain Ω 
#           for kvmap in kvmaps # loop over each "new" KVec
#               
#               cdmlᴮ = kvmap.kᴮlab # CDML label of "new" KVec kᴮ∈Φ-Ω
#               cdmlᴬ = kvmap.kᴮlab # CDML label of "old" KVec kᴬ∈Ω
#               R     = kvmap.op    # Mapping from kᴬ to kᴮ: kᴮ = Rkᴬ
#               # find index of kᴬ irreps in lgirsvec
#               idxᴬ = findfirst(lgirs->klabel(first(lgirs))==cdmlᴬ, lgirsvec)
#               lgirsᴬ = lgirsvec[idxᴬ]
#           end
#           # ... do stuff to lgirsᴬ to get lgirsᴮ via a transformation {R|v}
#           # derived from a holosymmetric parent group of sgnum and the transformation R
#       end
#
# The only kᴮ included in ISOTROPY is Z′≡ZA for sgs 195, 198, 200, 201, & 205: 
# all other kᴮ∈Φ-Ω points are omitted)
#
# Pa3 (Tₕ⁶), sg 205, cannot be treated by the transformation method and requires  
# manual treatment (B&C p. 415-417); fortunately, the Z′₁=ZA₁ irrep of 205 is  
# already included in ISOTROPY.
