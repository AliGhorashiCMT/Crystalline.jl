            αβγ::Union{Vector{<:Real},Nothing}=nothing)        --> Tuple{Int, Int}

Computes the Herring criterion for a little group irrep `ir`, from 

    [∑ χ({β|b}²)]/[g₀/M(k)] 

over symmetry operations {β,b} that take k → -k. Here g₀ is the order of the point group
of the space group and M(k) is the order of the star(k) [both in a primitive basis].

The returned value, [∑ χ({β|b}²)]/[g₀/M(k)], is one of three integers in {1,-1,0} 
corresponding to {real, pseudoreal, complex} reality. We remind that ISOTROPY's indication
of the same reality types i {1,2,3}.

The provided space group operations `sgops` **must** be the set reduced by primitive
translation vectors; i.e. using `spacegroup(...)` directly is **not** allowable in general
(since the irreps we reference only include these "reduced" operations). This reduced set
of operations can be obtained e.g. from the Γ point irreps of ISOTROPY's dataset, or
alternatively, from `reduce_ops(spacegroup(...), true)`.

As a sanity check, a value of `αβγ` can be provided to check for invariance
along a symmetry line/plane/general point in k-space. Obviously, the reality 
type should invariant to this choice.

**Implementation:** 
See e.g. Inui's Eq. (13.48), Dresselhaus, p. 618, and 
and Herring's original paper at https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRev.52.361.
