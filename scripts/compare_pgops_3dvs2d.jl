# the above results imply that we can employ a whole-sale transfer of irreps from 3D point
# groups to 2D point groups, because the 2D. vs. 3D settings never differ in a material way
# (only "2" and "m" point groups have such differences; but there, it doesn't impact the 
# transfer, because there's only two operations in each of these groups)
